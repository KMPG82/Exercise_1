            <p>
                Welcome to my page! My name is <strong>Kevin Ponting</strong> and currently I am a third year<br>
                computer science student at a university. I transferred from a community college<br>
                and I realized that a university campus is so much larger and nicer in comparison<br>
                to a community college one!<br>

            <!-- paragraph about hobbies -->
            <p>
                Above are a list of my many hobbies! I have only been playing basketball since<br>
                middle school, but it has positively affected my life in many ways. Honestly, I<br>
                only picked up lifting as a hobby because I wanted to be stronger for basketball.<br>
                On the other hand, video games have always been apart of my life ever since I was<br>
                a kid. I used to only play multiplayer games such as Call of Duty and NBA 2K but<br>
                recently I've only been playing single player games. As for my favorite games,<br>
                Terraria and Omori are my top two. Next, I love listening to music. Music helps<br>
                me focus and makes anything I'm doing fun. My favorite genres are K-Pop, J-Pop,<br>
                and rap. Lastly, I've been learning Japanese for about a year now and I've been<br>
                really enjoying it. My end goal is to be fluent and hopefully visit Japan one day!<br>
